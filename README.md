# 🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using supply chain emission factors from U.S. industries and commodities. The goal is to identify high-emission sectors and build predictive models for emission estimation based on industry and commodity information.
